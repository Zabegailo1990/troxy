                    <p class="text text--size-m p-terms__text">Introduction: Our company is committed to providing high-quality services and strictly adheres to the law. We firmly oppose any illegal actions or violations of our service terms.</p>
                    <p class="text text--size-m p-terms__text">Complaint Handling Fee: Due to the increase in administrative procedures and investigation of complaints, starting from January 22, 2024, we will charge a fee of $30 for processing each complaint related to the violation of our rules. This fee is not a “buyout” from violations and is intended solely to cover the costs of processing and investigation.</p>
                    <p class="text text--size-m p-terms__text">Complaint Processing Procedure: After receiving a complaint, we will conduct a comprehensive investigation to determine the facts and appropriate actions. The client will be notified of the complaint and given the opportunity to comment and explain.</p>
                    <p class="text text--size-m p-terms__text">Payment: An invoice for the complaint processing will be issued after the investigation is completed. Payment must be made within 3 days from the date of the invoice. And only after payment, the service will be unblocked (if possible and not contrary to our rules).</p>
                    <p class="text text--size-m p-terms__text">Serious or Repeated Violations: In the case of serious violations or multiple complaints about the actions of a client, we reserve the right to suspend or completely terminate the provision of services to that client. Our company strictly follows the principles of legality and does not tolerate violations of the conditions of use of our services. In such cases of serious or repeated violations, no refunds will be provided for the services already rendered or for the complaint handling fees incurred. We emphasize the importance of adhering to our service terms to maintain a fair and lawful service environment.</p>
                    <p class="text text--size-m p-terms__text">Exceptions and Provisos: Under certain circumstances, at the discretion of our company, a decision may be made to exempt from the complaint processing fee, especially if the client actively cooperates and takes measures to prevent future incidents.</p>
